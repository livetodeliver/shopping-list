# Shopping List App Challenge

This is a completed app challenge that was part of Thinkful's Front-End Fundamentals program. 

It was created using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. 

You can view the live version of this app [here](https://livetodeliver.github.io/stacy-shopping-list/).

### Future changes

I would like to alter this app and further stylize it to make it more unique and personal.
